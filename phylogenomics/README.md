# Reconstruction of the phylogenetic tree of A. rufa position whithin the Phasianidae




## Requirements tools
1. Protein-coding sequences of close-related birds species to the partridge (*Alectoris rufa*). can be dowloaded from the NCBI.
2. [busco](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/busco).
2. [fasttree](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/fasttree)
3. [IQEE-TREE](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/iqtree)
4. [ASTRAL](https://github.com/smirarab/ASTRAL)
5. [FigTree](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/figtree)
6. [BUSCO_phylogenomics](https://github.com/jamiemcg/BUSCO_phylogenomics) for procesing the shared single copy gene in order to infer the supermatrix of individual gene trees.
7. [PAML](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/paml) is usful to estimate the Divergence time. i cocommended looking at this [Tutorial](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/MCMCtree.Tutorials.pdf)
